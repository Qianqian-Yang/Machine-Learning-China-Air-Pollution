# China-Air-Pollution
This hub is for a project for research on China air pollution PM 2.5, including research references, data sources, and a list of our codes and result. 

Nowadays, China air pollution is a pressing issue in the China society, since it might be the cause of the recent dramastic inceases of lung cancers.
